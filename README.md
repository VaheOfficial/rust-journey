This is going to be my progress from start to finish in learning rust. Started messing around with it and made a very basic calculator so far. Lets see where it takes me.

### Current implementation

- Youtube downloader takes in youtube link and path whehre it will output the video to.
- MSFVenom creator will generate a payload and instructions to create payloads.
